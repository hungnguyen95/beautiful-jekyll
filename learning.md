I recommend you guys some courses and books which you can learn more about machine learning, deep learning.

### Machine Learning and Deep Learning

#### Courses
- ["Machine Learning", Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) - online class by Andrew Ng (highly recommended)
- [CS224n: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/)
